- In project 2, I am responsible to design the layout of the webpage(HTML and CSS) and apply the ajax renderer technique into 'Live Rates' and 'Avaliable Cryptocurrenies List'. 
- After fetching the api, the data would be stored in _data and _data2 for the 'Live Rates' and the 'Avaliable Cryptocurrenies List' respectively. We can search a live rate or an info of avaliable cryptocurreny by a specfic symbol from user input, and get the data of that specific symbol without fetching the api again.

- Output:<br>
